# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Network

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that performs breast cancer classification using a Neural Network implemented with TensorFlow.

## Overview

This project implements a Neural Network model using TensorFlow to classify breast cancer cases. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment. The model aims to accurately classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-NN.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, define and train the Neural Network model for breast cancer classification.

## Files

- `breast_cancer_classification_nn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for breast cancer classification using a Neural Network.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset obtained from scikit-learn used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from scikit-learn and includes features related to breast cancer cases. The model predicts whether the cancer is malignant or benign based on these features.
